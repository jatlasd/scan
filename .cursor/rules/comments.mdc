# NO COMMENTS IN CODE

When providing code suggestions:
1. NEVER include any comments within the code itself
2. NEVER use comment syntax (// or /* */ or #) in any code blocks
3. NEVER add explanatory comments inline with code
4. NEVER add TODOs or FIXMEs in comments

This applies to all programming languages and all code suggestions without exception.
