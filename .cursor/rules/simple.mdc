globs: **/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}
---
- Write clean, minimal, and maintainable code.
- Avoid excessive abstraction; keep functions and components straightforward.
- Prefer readable and declarative code over complex optimizations.
- Use simple conditionals and avoid nested ternaries.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose; avoid unnecessary parameters.
- Favor native language features over external dependencies when possible.
- Avoid premature optimization; focus on clarity first.
- Remove unused code and avoid unnecessary abstractions.
- Use consistent patterns but avoid over-engineering solutions.
- Keep component hierarchies shallow and props minimal.
